# Airbnb Clone Project

Airbnb Clone Project is a comprehensive, real-world application designed to simulate the development of a robust booking platform like Airbnb.

## Team Roles
- **ET-Touil Abdelilah**: Software Developer

## Technology Stack
<!-- 
- Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js, Express
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Authentication: JWT
-->

## Feature Breakdown

### 1. User Management
Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles securely. Authentication ensures only verified users can book properties or host their own listings.

### 2. Property Management
Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings with descriptions, images, location data, and pricing. This feature powers the core hosting experience.

### 3. Booking System
Enables users to search for available properties by location and date, then book them through an intuitive interface. Manages availability and prevents double bookings.

### 4. Search and Filtering
Users can filter properties based on price, date availability, amenities, and more. This enhances the user experience by making it easier to find suitable stays.

### 5. Reviews and Ratings
After their stay, users can leave reviews and ratings for properties. This builds trust in the platform and helps future guests make informed decisions.

### 6. Favorites (Wishlist)
Users can save properties to a favorites list for quick access later. This allows guests to plan trips more efficiently.

### 7. Admin Dashboard *(Optional)*
An admin panel to manage users, properties, and bookings. Useful for platform moderators to monitor activities and enforce rules.

## API Security

Securing backend APIs is a critical part of the Airbnb Clone project to ensure data integrity, user trust, and protection against malicious activities. Below are the key security measures that will be implemented:

### 1. Authentication
Only registered users can access protected routes using secure login systems (e.g., JWT or OAuth). Authentication helps verify the identity of users and prevents unauthorized access to accounts and sensitive operations.

### 2. Authorization
Different levels of access are enforced (e.g., guest, host, admin). Authorization ensures that users can only perform actions they're permitted to (e.g., a user canâ€™t delete another user's listing).

### 3. Rate Limiting
Rate limiting protects the backend from abuse by limiting the number of API requests a user can make within a specific timeframe. This helps mitigate brute-force attacks and reduce server load.

### 4. Input Validation & Sanitization
All incoming data will be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS). This ensures that user input doesn't compromise the database or application behavior.

### 5. HTTPS Enforcement
All communication with the backend will use HTTPS to encrypt data in transit. This protects sensitive data like login credentials and payment information from being intercepted.

### 6. Secure Data Storage
Sensitive data such as passwords will be hashed (e.g., using bcrypt) before storage. Storing passwords securely protects users in case of a database breach.

### 7. Error Handling
Error messages will be managed to avoid exposing stack traces or internal system details. Proper error handling improves security by not leaking information that attackers could use.

Security is crucial in this project to protect user personal data, maintain system stability, secure financial transactions, and build user trust in the platform.

## CI/CD Pipeline

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipelines automate the process of testing, building, and deploying code changes. They help ensure that new features or bug fixes are integrated smoothly without breaking the existing functionality.

For the Airbnb Clone project, CI/CD is important because it:
- Automates testing to catch errors early.
- Speeds up development by reducing manual deployment steps.
- Ensures consistent and reliable delivery of updates to production or staging environments.

### Tools Used:
- **GitHub Actions**: Automates workflows such as testing and deploying the application when code is pushed or a pull request is made.
- **Docker**: Standardizes the development and deployment environments using containers.
- **Docker Hub or GitHub Packages**: Stores and manages container images.
- **(Optional)**: **Vercel**, **Netlify**, or **Heroku** can be used for frontend deployment; **Render**, **Railway**, or **DigitalOcean** for backend services.

A well-configured CI/CD pipeline improves developer productivity, reduces bugs in production, and speeds up the release cycle.
